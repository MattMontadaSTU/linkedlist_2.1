The time complexity of the solution for 2.2 is O(n).

This time complexity can be met the fastest solution with the following solution/steps:
1. Maintain 2 types of pointers (Main pointer and reference pointer)
2. Initialize both pointers to head
3. Move the reference pointer to n nodes from head
4. Move both pointers one by one until the reference pointer reaches the end
5. Have the main pointer point to the nth node from the end.
6. Have the main pointer return to its original spot.
